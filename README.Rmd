This `R` Package contains all the datasets that are used in the book "*All things `R` Spatial: An introduction to spatial-R for recovering ArcGIS users*". 
You can install it via github with the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(arc2r)
library(sf)

data("kantonsgebiet")

plot(kantonsgebiet["NAME"])

```
