## Follow Along

Hi! It's really nice to have you here. If you are reading these lines, you are on the verge of following along the tutorials described in our book "All things R Spatial", which we host here: https://arc2r.github.io/book. You have installed the "arc2r" package, started a new RStudio project and selected our template project.

In this template, you will find some R-Markdown files with the same code which is used in the book. Each Rmd-file is named after the chapter of which the code originates, so it should be easy to find the appropriate Rmd-File for the chapter you want to follow along. 

If you have any questions or stumble into problems, please don't hesitate and file an issue on our repo: https://github.com/arc2r/book/issues

Have fun!
